The blog management system is a project which can
be used by us to manage any type of blog in a
efficient way.
This contains the two ways of entering the system:
One is admin mode in which we can do operations as
owner and have full access over operations and
second is user mode in which one can enter as user
and perform operation to interact as user.
In Admin mode we have functions to see user details,
feedback details, blog details, login details etc.
In user mode we have functions to make a new user,
see existing blogs, creating new blog, for
notification, to give the feed back etc
